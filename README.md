# Chess Game Project

This is a personal project where I try to code up a Chess Game. <br>
Implemented in Java, I hope to have the following features.

## Features Implemented
- ❌ Player vs Player
- ❌ CPU vs Player
- ❌ CPU built off a mini-max algorithm (then grow it to a more complex algorithm)
- ❌ Then maybe make it look nice
